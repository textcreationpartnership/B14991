            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Leaders after a little deliberation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øcended all pre≈øently to his advi≈øe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the command of the Prince
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177444:3"/>of <hi>Orange.</hi> As ≈øoone as they were return'd in their Garri≈øon, they vnder≈øtood, that the Spani≈øh Forces, twelue thou≈øand ≈øtrong, marched towards the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Wowe:</hi> And vpon the 18. of Iuly, the≈øe of <hi>Steen berghen</hi> perceived that their Towne was to be be≈øieged, being vnawares, and vnprovided of many things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øu≈øtaine a ≈øiege, ≈øeeing it is a place of no great importance. Mon≈øieur <hi>Borwater</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the place, being a braue Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was much di≈øcontented with this Newes, ≈øeeing he wanted both men and Munition, having but one peece of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Towne, and that vn≈øervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, layd before the Ho≈øpitall without the appurtenances. It is certaine, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> few dayes before the ≈øiege, ≈øent thether a Gunner, and had given charge to a Commi≈ø≈øioner to convay thether fiue or ≈øix Cannons, but what≈øoever the cau≈øe is, it was not performed: And the Women of the Towne much di≈øcontented with the ≈øayd Commi≈ø≈øioner, would haue ca≈øt him the afore≈øayd Munday (being the 18. of Iuly) into the water; the ≈øaid day about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177444:4"/>noone is the enemy come ≈øo neere to the Towne, that their voyces might be heard by the Garri≈øon, and turn'd pre≈øently their Ordinance, and di≈øcharged the ≈øame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Towne, not having made any Battery.</p>
            <p>And having made a rea≈øonable bigge breach in the walles with ≈øixtie Cannon ≈øhot, the Inhabitants began to looke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, the rather becau≈øe they had not heard of late the noy≈øe of ≈øuch Heath Crickets. A few houres before, went a great number of women and children, crying and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, out of the Towne; which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely a pittifull ≈øpectacle to beholde.</p>
            <p>What concernes the cryes and laments heard by me, as well of tho≈øe that were within as without <hi>Tertolen,</hi> the <hi>C'limder</hi> and the <hi>Plaet.</hi> I will not ≈øpeake of, they carry away all what they will not loo≈øe.</p>
            <p>I could more liuely Relate how they cry and lament, and wring their hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one, for her husband, the other, for her childe, leaping in and out the boats (≈øaying) that they will remayne, where fle≈øh and bloud is lo≈øt, goods are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177444:4"/>in ≈øuch ca≈øes. In tho≈øe places where the≈øe things happen, there is no di≈øputing whether they be Papi≈øts, Prote≈øtants, or Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, but mu≈øt ioyntly re≈øi≈øt the inva≈øion of the enemies.</p>
            <p>On thur≈øday the 19. of Iuly did the enemies ≈øend a Trumpet to the Towne, to aske whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would Parley. That otherwi≈øe, his Forces ≈øtanding readie in Battell array, ≈øhould a≈ø≈øault the towne where the breach was made. Declaring moreover, that they would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence before they had brought the Towne vnder the obedience of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The valiant Governour <hi>Borwater,</hi> with two Captaines, and the Gentlemen of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and ≈øome of the Magi≈øtrats of the place, re≈øolved to keepe the Towne, vntill the la≈øt man, for the <hi>States.</hi> But they reque≈øted the Trumpet, that he would try whether the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would conde≈øcend to a ce≈ø≈øation of Armes for few houres onely; wherevpon, he returned pre≈øently to <hi>Don Lewis de V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>In the meane time, they ≈øent ≈øome to looke whether they could not ≈øee (≈øtanding vpon the Steeple) any Shippes comming with ayde.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177444:5"/>But afterwards, ≈øeeing that the enemy divided his Forces in three ≈øeverall Troopes, to a≈ø≈øault the towne in divers places, and that they were not able to defend the ≈øame, ≈øeeing it had no Countre≈øcarps, or Bulwarkes, but onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine round Towers of no ≈øtrength. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe in con≈øideration of the lamentations of women and Cittizens which had any thing to loo≈øe, they could not re≈øolue almo≈øt what to doe. And to ≈øpeake the truth, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther i≈ø≈øue to be expected, then that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and armed Cittizens, ≈øhould be ≈ølaine, as al≈øo all the re≈øt, and all their goods pillaged, and made havock off.</p>
            <p>At the ≈øame in≈øtant, the Trumpet being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, told them that the enemy would not grant them as much as the ≈øpace of an houre. But if they would ≈øurrender the Towne, they ≈øhould haue good conditions, and be well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, otherwi≈øe they mu≈øt doe as the cau≈øe ≈øhould require.</p>
            <p>The Governour was vnwilling to yeeld, but mo≈øt Voyces carryed away, and agreed vpon the≈øe following Conditions and Articles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the Souldiers with their Armes and Armour, be≈øides Baggage ≈øhould depart, and be conducted with a ≈øafe Convoy.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:177444:5"/>
            <p n="2">2. That the Towne≈ømen ≈øhould pay two thou≈øand Gilders (which is 200.<hi rend="sup">li.</hi> Sterling) to the Souldiers, to hinder their pillaging.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all the Towne≈ømen after the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid money is payd, ≈øhall haue libertie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with their goods where they li≈øt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That tho≈øe that would remaine there, and liue according to their Lawes, Cu≈øtomes, and Ceremonies, they might, and ≈øhould be v≈øed as other Inhabitants of the obey≈øant Citties and Townes of <hi>Brabant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the≈øe conditions is the Towne ≈øurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the afore≈øaid Munday before noone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 19. of Iuly. The Governour had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe leaue to convay his goods away.

            <p>At their departure there was a woman that philipping vpon her thumbe, told to ≈øome of the Souldiers, now you mu≈øt foorth and our friends ≈øhall come in.</p>
            <p>This Towne was be≈øet with 9.
